# milchundzucker/elasticsearch-icu

This is a docker image with preinstalled ICU plugin. The ICU plugin is part of the core from version 2.0 on. 
For the version before 2.0 (1.x) one has to install it manually from 
[elastic/elasticsearch-analysis-icu](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-analysis-icu) and restart all 
your nodes. This images aims to ease up the use of ElasticSearch with that plugin for older ElasticSearch versions.
